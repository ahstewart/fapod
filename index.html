<h1>Fake Astronomy Picture of the Day</h1>
<p>Inspired by NASA's fantastic "Astronomy Picture of the Day" site, this is a silly excuse to explore ML applications for astronomical imaging.</p>
<p>Here I use a text-to-image model trained on the APOD archives to try and generate a fake image from the day's description.</p>

alt="A starfield is shown that includes a bright comet.
A bright tail points to the upper right but has an
unusual dark streak in it. A thin anti-tail points
toward the lower left.
Please see the explanation for more detailed information."
